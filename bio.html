    <h3>Education and Licensure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Master of Science in Engineering, Transportation Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, May 2021 </li>
      <li>Bachelor of Science, Civil and Environmental Engineering, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, May 2019 </li>
      <li>Enrolled Professional Engineer Intern, State of Illinois, License No. 061.040866 </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    I am from Carbondale, a town in southern Illinois. I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) for my undergraduate studies in civil engineering, with a primary focus
    in transportation and a secondary focus in hydrology. At UIUC, I participated in undergraduate research in the lab of Dr. Jeffery Roesler, where I assisted with concrete pavement testing and analysis.
    At UIUC, I was also active in student organizations, namely the ASCE and ITE student chapters. I also gained valuable design and construction inspection experience for roadway reconstruction
    and water, sanitary, and storm sewer projects as an intern for an engineering consultant in Champaign, Illinois. I further gained professional experience as an intern for a pavement management
    consultant, where I performed pavement inspections.
    <br><br>
    For my graduate studies, I am attending the University of Texas at Austin, first working under the supervision of the late Dr. Zhanmin Zhang in the Resilient Infrastructure and Smart Cities (RISC) Lab. 
    During my MSE, I worked as a graduate research assistant (GRA) on a project for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) related to assessing the resilience of the Texas maritime port
    system. My MS thesis was about conceptual risk assessment methods for multi-modal port systems in Texas. For my doctoral studies, I currently work with Dr. Stephen Boyles in the Simulation, 
    Parking, Autonomous vehicles, Routing, & Traffic Assignment (SPARTA) lab. As a GRA, I have worked on a TxDOT project examining the usage of real-time traffic monitoring devices during hurricane
    evacuations in Texas. I have worked on the topics of infrastructure management, transportation networks, and intermodal freight resilience. An going project with the US Army Corps of Engineers, 
    serving as the basis for my dissertation, uses data-driven methods to calibrate a discrete event simulation, used to assess the capacity and resilience of maritime freight systems.
    <br><br>
    When I am not working on campus, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I love being outdoors and I enjoy running, biking, swimming, and kayaking in Austin and the nearby Texas
    Hill Country. I also play guitar, and I am an avid player and listener of classic country and bluegrass music.
